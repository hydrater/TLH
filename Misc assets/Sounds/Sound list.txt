FOREWORD:
What i have given you are raw sound files that need editing, i'd have the art team do this but unfortunately none of us
know how. All the instructions are listed below for each individual sound file. Files that say (2 different variations each)
require 2 different output files to give a blend different sounds. e.g 2 files for 2 different footsteps. You make tweak the
volumes and speed of certain files as you see fit, but try your best to balance them to the best of your ability.
Keep the sound effects short and sweet.
